# Webix-Chatbot-First-Design

This is a small demo that contains my first attempt at creating a chatbox with Webix.
For the matter the a small js demo was created - the window component plays the main role for the "pop up" that is supposed to be shown when wanting to communicate with the LLM.
Using MaterialDesign for the icon.

The ollama part of the code understadibly does not work, since it was not implemented properly, however we have a starting point for the design.
